## 20 Days of Python – Course Map


This repo is a 20‑day Python roadmap. Each day has one or more example scripts,
kept very small so you can read and run them quickly.

Below is a short guide you can share on LinkedIn or anywhere else.

### Overview

- **Days 1–4**: Core syntax, variables, operators, strings, numbers
- **Days 5–8**: Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- **Days 9–11**: Conditionals, loops, functions, scope
- **Days 12–16**: Modules, decorators, useful built‑ins, errors, regex, generators
- **Days 17–20**: OOP, virtual environments, statistics/NumPy, and a small login project

---

### How to use this repo

- Open a **day folder**, pick any script, and run it with:

```bash
python "Day X/some_file.py"
```

- Use the file names as a hint for the topic you want to revise.
- Day 20 gives you a small but realistic project that ties together:
  - JSON
  - a third‑party library (`requests`)
  - and a simple package layout.
