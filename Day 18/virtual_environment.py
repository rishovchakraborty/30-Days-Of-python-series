# Virtual environment can help us to create an isolated or separate environment. This will help us to avoid conflicts in dependencies across projects.

# . If you write pip freeze on your terminal you will see all the installed packages on your computer. 

# If we use virtualenv, we will access only packages which are specific for that project.

# pip install virtualenv

# After installing the virtualenv package go to your project folder and create a virtual env by writing:

# python -m venv venv      for windows
# venv\Scripts\activate    for activations

# deactivate               to deactivate
